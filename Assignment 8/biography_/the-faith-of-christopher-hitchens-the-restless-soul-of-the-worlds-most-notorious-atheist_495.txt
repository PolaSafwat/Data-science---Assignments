Book Description: âIf everyone in the United States had the same qualities of loyalty and care and concern for others that Larry Taunton had, we'd be living in a much better society than we do.â ~ Christopher HitchensAt the time of his death, Christopher Hitchens was the most notorious atheist in the world. And yet, all was not as it seemed. âNobody is not a divided self, of course,â heonce âIf everyone in the United States had the same qualities of loyalty and care and concern for others that Larry Taunton had, we'd be living in a much better society than we do.â ~ Christopher HitchensAt the time of his death, Christopher Hitchens was the most notorious atheist in the world. Â And yet, all was not as it seemed. Â âNobody is not a divided self, of course,â heÂ once told an interviewer,Â âbut I think itâs rather strong in my case.â Â  Hitchens wasÂ a man of many contradictions: Â  a Marxist in youth who longed for acceptance among the social elites; a peacenik who revered the military; a champion of the Left who was nonetheless pro-life, pro-war-on-terror, and after 9/11 something of a neocon; and while he railed against God on stage, he maintained meaningfulâthough largely hidden from public viewâfriendships with evangelical Christians like Francis Collins, Douglas Wilson, and the author Larry Alex Taunton. Â InÂ The Faith of Christopher Hitchens, Taunton offers aÂ very personal perspective of one of our most interesting and most misunderstood public figures. Â Writing with genuine compassion and without compromise, TauntonÂ traces Hitchensâs spiritual and intellectual development from his decision as a teenager to reject belief in God to his rise to prominence as one of the so-calledÂ âFour Horsemenâ of the New Atheism.Â  While Hitchens was, in the minds of many Christians,Â Public Enemy Number One, away from the lights andÂ theÂ cameras a warm friendship flourished between Hitchens and the author; a friendship thatÂ culminatedÂ inÂ not one, butÂ twoÂ lengthy road trips where, after Hitchensâs diagnosis of esophageal cancer, they studied the Bible together. Â The Faith of Christopher HitchensÂ gives us a candidÂ glimpse into the inner life of this intriguing, sometimes maddening, and unexpectedly vulnerable man.âThis book should be read by every atheist and theist passionate about the truth.â--Michael Shermer, publisher, Skeptic magazine ...more
