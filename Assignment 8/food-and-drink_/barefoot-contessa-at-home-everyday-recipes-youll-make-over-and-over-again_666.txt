She will be the first to tell you, though, that nothing beats a cozy dinner, surrounded by the people you love most, in the comfort that only your own home can provide. In Barefoot Contessa at Home, Ina shares her life in East Hampton, the recipes she loves, and her secrets to making guests feel welcome and comfortable. For Ina, itâs friends and familyâgathered around the dinner table or cooking with her in the kitchenâthat really make her house feel like home. Here Ina offers the tried-and-true recipes that she makes over and over again because theyâre easy, they work, and theyâre universally loved. For a leisurely Sunday breakfast, she has Easy Cheese Danishes or Breakfast Fruit Crunch to serve with the perfect Spicy Bloody Mary. For lunch, she has classics with a twist, such as Tomato, Mozzarella, and Pesto Paninis and Old-Fashioned Potato Salad, which are simply delicious. Then there are Inaâs homey dinnersâfrom her own version of loin of pork stuffed with sautÃ©ed fennel to the exotic flavors of Eliâs Asian Salmon. And since Ina knows no one ever forgets what you serve for dessert, she includes recipes for outrageously luscious sweets like Peach and Blueberry Crumble, Pumpkin Mousse Parfait, and Chocolate Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Icing. Ina also lets readers in on her time-tested secrets for cooking and entertaining. Get the inside scoop on everything from what Ina considers when sheâs designing a kitchen to menu-planning basics and how to make a dinner party fun (hereâs a hint: it doesnâ t involve making complicated food!).
