Book Description: A life shared with pets brings many emotions. We feel love for our companions, certainly, and happiness at the thought that weâre providing them with a safe, healthy life. But thereâs another emotion, less often acknowledged, that can be nearly as powerful: guilt.

We feel love for our companions, certainly, and happiness at the thought that weâre providing them with a safe, healthy life. But thereâs another emotion, less often acknowledged, that can be nearly as powerful: guilt.

Is keeping pets actually good for the pets themselves? Â  Thatâs the question that animates Jessica Pierceâs powerful Run, Spot, Run.

But she also refuses to deny the ambiguous ethics at the heart of the relationship, and through a mix of personal stories, philosophical reflections, and scientifically informed analyses of animal behavior and natural history, she puts pet-keeping to the test.

And are there ways that we can improve our petsâ lives, so that we can be confident that we are giving them as much as they give us? Â  Deeply empathetic, yet rigorous and unflinching in her thinking, Pierce has written a book that is sure to help any pet owner, unsettling assumptions but also giving them the knowledge to build deeper, better relationships with the animals with whom theyâve chosen to share their lives. ...more
