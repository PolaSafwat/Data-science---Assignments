Why not have both?Becoming a full-time entrepreneur can look glamorous from the outside. Who doesnât want to chase their dreams, be their own boss, and do what they love? But the truth is that entrepreneurship is often a slog, with no regular hours, no job security, and very little pay. Â What if there was a way to have the stability of a day job with the excitement of a startup? All of the benefits of entrepreneurship with none of the pitfalls?

Â McGinnis details a step-by-step plan that takes you from identifying your first entrepreneurial project to figuring out the smartest way to commit resources to it.

Most importantly, you donât have to have millions in disposable income to become a 10% Entrepreneur.
