They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the future. They question, praise and criticize God in the hopes of better understanding themselves and others. In a world challenged by economic issues, climate change, war, and constant threat of terrorism, people are pausing from their daily routines to ask the deeper questions and wonder about the divine and mysterious nature of their Creator.In this book, author and spiritual seeker Mare Cromwell interviews people from all walks of life, asking, âIf I gave you Godâs phone number, what would you do with it?â This spiritual memoir, framed by twenty-one interviews with people from all walks of life, combines the oral tradition of Studs Terkel with the soulful searchings of Neale Donald Welsh. If I gave you Godâs phone numberâ¦ offers the reader what only the best books offerâwindows into the most authentic reaches of the soul. Cromwellâs conscientious selection of interview subjects, and her deft questioning, which presses them to go deeper and deeper, is what lends the book its striking range. This diorama of spiritual posturesâsome passionate, some highly intellectualizedâis impossible to look away from, infects the reader with a fever of curiosity about the human condition, and then proceeds to administer the careful cure: vivid, compelling testimony. Not only do her many subjects nourish the reader by their telling, but Cromwell too provides ongoing doses of self-revelation, a gesture of honesty that unifies and strengthens the whole picture. Reading If I gave you Godâs phone numberâ¦. will enrich your view of spiritual lifeâin all its radiant varietyâforever.What people are saying about If I gave you Godâs phone numberâ¦"I strongly recommend this engaging, thought-provoking book.
